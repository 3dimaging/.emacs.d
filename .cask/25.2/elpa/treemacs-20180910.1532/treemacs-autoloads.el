Find a bookmark in treemacs.
Only bookmarks marking either a file or a directory are offered for selection.
Treemacs will try to find and focus the given bookmark's location, in a similar
fashion to `treemacs-find-file'.

With a prefix argument ARG treemacs will also open the bookmarked location.

Find and focus the current file in the treemacs window.
If the current buffer has visits no file or with a prefix ARG ask for the
file instead.

For the most part only useful when `treemacs-follow-mode' is not active.

Find and move point to the tag at point in the treemacs view.
Most likley to be useful when `treemacs-tag-follow-mode' is not active.

Will ask to change the treemacs root if the file to find is not under the
root. If no treemacs buffer exists it will be created with the current file's
containing directory as root. Will do nothing if the current buffer is not
visiting a file or Emacs cannot find any tags for the current file.

Bring it to the foreground if it is not visible.

SIZE in pixels icons should be resized to.

If SIZE is 'nil' the icons are not resized and will retain their default size of
22 pixels.

There is only one size, the icons are square and the aspect ratio will be
preserved when resizing them therefore width and height are the same.

Resizing the icons only works if Emacs was built with ImageMagick support. If
this is not the case this function will report an error.

Custom icons are not taken into account, only the site of treemacs' own icons
is changed.

Define a custom ICON to use for FILE-EXTENSIONS.

Note that treemacs has a very loose definition of what constitutes a file
extension - it's either everything past the last period, or just the file's full
name if there is no period. This makes it possible to match file names like
'.gitignore' and 'Makefile'.

FILE-EXTENSIONS are also not case sensitive and will be downcased before they're
inserted into `treemacs-icons-hash'.

Remaps icons for EXTENSIONS according to `auto-mode-alist'.

MODE-ICON-ALIST is an alist that maps which mode from `auto-mode-alist' should
be assigned which treemacs icon, for exmaple
'((c-mode . treemacs-icon-c)
